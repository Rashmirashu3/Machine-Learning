1.	Regression:
Y – Observation, Response or dependent variable
X – Predictor, Covariate, feature or independent variable

Data –  1. Training set
	2. Test set
•	RSS for training data set points is training error and test data is test error.
•	As we increase model complexity or order, training error decreases. Whereas test error decreasing and increases as order increases.
•	We split the data into train and test, we build the linear regression model on train, later evaluate and predict on the test.
